# SVN to GIT

The practical part is spitted into several units.

- [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FQ1iOAqmDUwzEQRlYtpFY1bO9IpOgembRfRZ6hCK0-A/edit?usp=sharing)

## Units

- [Command line](./schulung/PRAXIS00_CLI.md)
- [Pull Request for feature/branch](./schulung/PRAXIS01_FEATURE_BRANCH.md)
- [Gitflow feature/branch](./schulung/PRAXIS02_GITFLOW_FEATURE_BRANCH.md)
- [Gitflow release](./schulung/PRAXIS03_GITFLOW_RELEASE.md)
- [Gitflow hotfix](./schulung/PRAXIS04_GITFLOW_HOTFIX.md)
- [Fork](./schulung/PRAXIS05_FORK.md)
- [Squashing](./schulung/PRAXIS06_UTIL_SQUASH.md)
- [Stashing](./schulung/PRAXIS07_UTIL_STASH.md)
- [Conflicts](./schulung/PRAXIS08_UTIL_CONFLICT.md)

## Unit working flow

Every unit contains a set of cli commands to demonstrate a feature of git inclusive theirs relationships.

## Unit format

Every unit has 2 different declaration parts.

1. `command list` - its short list of commands to execute

2. `command list with output`  - its a complete list of command + expected output

Feel free to change the commands processing. Its up to You whats happen :D.

## Usage of UI tools like SourceTree

Feel free to open a UI tool in parallel at the same local resource. Its recomment to use the UI tool as additional resource to get an overview whats happen. But donÂ´t try to run the command first in the UI. Every UI has his own abstraction of GIT. With some magic behaviour inside.
